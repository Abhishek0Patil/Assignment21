In this case, we would reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in student performance between the two teaching methods at a 0.01 significance level.\n",

With a larger sample size, the t-test has more power to detect a significant difference if it exists. The interpretation of the results depends on the calculated t-statistic and the corresponding p-value compared to the chosen significance level."
